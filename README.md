## Latest news

* 01/06/2017: Version 3.0.0 is finally out! See what's new [here](https://github.com/j-easy/easy-rules/releases).
* 18/05/2017: Version 2.5.0 is out with new features and bug fixes. See all details in the [change log](https://github.com/j-easy/easy-rules/releases).

## What is Easy Rules?

Easy Rules is a Java rules engine inspired by an article called *"[Should I use a Rules Engine?](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/RulesEngine.html)"* of [Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/) in which Martin says:

> You can build a simple rules engine yourself. All you need is to create a bunch of objects with conditions and actions, store them in a collection, and run through them to evaluate the conditions and execute the actions.

This is exactly what Easy Rules does, it provides the `Rule` abstraction to create rules with conditions and actions, and the `RulesEngine` API that runs through a set of rules to evaluate conditions and execute actions.

## Core features

 * Lightweight library and easy to learn API
 * POJO based development with annotation programming model
 * Useful abstractions to define business rules and apply them easily with Java
 * The ability to create composite rules from primitive ones

## Example

##### First, define your rule..

```java
@Rule(name = "weather rule", description = "if it rains then take an umbrella" )
public class WeatherRule {

    @Condition
    public boolean itRains(@Fact("rain") boolean rain) {
        return rain;
    }
    
    @Action
    public void takeAnUmbrella() {
        System.out.println("It rains, take an umbrella!");
    }
}
```

##### Then, fire it!

```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // define facts
        Facts facts = new Facts();
        facts.put("rain", true);

        // define rules
        Rules rules = new Rules(new WeatherRule());

        // fire rules on known facts
        RulesEngine rulesEngine = new DefaultRulesEngine();
        rulesEngine.fire(rules, facts);
    }
}
```

This is the hello world of Easy Rules. You can find other examples like the [FizzBuzz](https://github.com/j-easy/easy-rules/wiki/fizz-buzz) or [WebApp](https://github.com/j-easy/easy-rules/wiki/web-app) tutorials in the wiki.
